            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is when you have one main repository that houses and keeps all your project files. When working with multiple team members, members can check out a file and make changes to the file, then check it back in which is referred to as “commit”. One of the main advantages of version control is it really solves that file sharing problem, where different members of a team can overwrite each other’s work, sometimes unintentionally. With version control you are able to share files and avoid these problems from occurring. This is critical when working with a team and can save so much time and headache from mishaps such as these, version control is an excellent method to adopt to avoid these types of situations completely.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are tools used to keep track of the many different versions and configurations of a project, piece of software, webpage, etc. These tools are key not only when working alone on a task, but even more so when working with multiple people on the same thing, collaboratively. A version control system allows multiple users to make changes simultaneously while recording when the changed occurred, what kind of changes were made and who made these changes. This allows accurate and precise analysis of the changes being made to a project and facilitates further discussion upon the merits of each decision made by an individual.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository that resides on the remote server, a remote server is a common single repository that all developers will have access to. It holds all files and versions of that file that are shared among users. Every user will have a copy of that repository that resides on their machine, this is referred to as a local repository. This allows users to make changes to versions of files on their local machine and push these new versions to the remote repository that is shared by all users. Working locally allows you to work offline on these files anywhere you may be, even without having access to the internet.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">	Git is a version control system that has become very popular in recent years. Git is very lightweight, and one of the newest implementations out there. Git is extremely fast, which is important to users as it doesn’t get in the way. It provides a history, not only on an individual basis, but of all the files that compose a project. Not only does git record textual changes, but it also keeps track of graphics, files, designs and so on that are implemented though the working process. Git also facilitates collaboration, which helps to make sense of multiple people working on the same project at the same time. The user interface of git is very simple and sleek, making it a pleasing experience to work with.</p>
